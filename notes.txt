p>Hello darkness, my old friend<br/>I&#39;ve come to talk with you again<br/>Because a vision softly creeping<br/>Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br/>And the vision that was planted in my brain<br/>Still remains<br/>Within the sound of silence<br/></p><p>In restless dreams I walked alone<br/>Narrow streets of cobblestone<br/>&#39;Neath the halo of a street lamp<br/>I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br/>When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br/>That split the night<br/>And touched the sound of silence<br/></p><p>And in the naked light I saw<br/>Ten thousand people, maybe more<br/>People talking without speaking<br/>People hearing without listening<br/>People writing songs that voices never share<br/>And no one dared<br/>Disturb the sound of silence<br/></p><p>&quot;Fools&quot; said I<br/>&quot;You do not know, silence like a cancer grows<br/>Hear my words that I might teach you<br/>Take my arms that I might reach you&quot;<br/>But my words like silent raindrops fell<br/>And echoed<br/>In the wells of silence<br/></p><p>And the people bowed and prayed<br/>To the neon god they made<br/>And the sign flashed out its warning<br/>In the words that it was forming<br/>And the signs said<br/>&quot;The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br/>And tenement halls<br/>And whisper&#39;d in the sounds of silence<br/>
